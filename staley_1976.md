#  Prosthecobacter fusiformis nov. gen. et sp., the fusiform caulobacter 

### summery
> they explain their findings and justify why the organism should be classified as a new species.

- they collected samples from freshwater sources.  
- four strains of heterotrophic fusiform caulobacters were isolated from these samples.  
- morphologically, these bacteria resemble *Caulobacter*. they possess a single prostheca extending from one pole of mature cells, which aids in attachment to various substrates through a holdfast located at the distal tip of the appendage.  
- however, they differ in several key aspects:  
  - they lack the dimorphic life cycle of *Caulobacter*. Instead of producing motile, non-stalked daughter cells, their daughter cells are immotile and are identical mirror-image replicas of the mother cells.  
  - the prosthecae of these fusiform caulobacters lack crossbands, are wider, and end in a bulbous tip.  
  - their DNA base composition (GC content) ranges from 54.6% to 60%, whereas *Caulobacter* has a GC content of 62–67%.  

_notice that bacteria are living a 3D life and not a 2D view you see under a microscope._


### introduction
> they outlined the historical progression of discoveries related to this strain, from the first scientist who identified it to the present findings.

- in 1935, henrici and johnson noted that stalked bacteria are an important component of the bacterial periphyton in lakes. they observed unicellular organisms with a single polar stalk and proposed the genus *caulobacter*, distinguishing two morphologically distinct types: **one**, a vibrioid to rod-shaped stalked cell that produced non-stalked daughter cells (possibly motile), and **the other**, a fusiform type, which they inferred to be immotile. the fusiform type's daughter cells attached to the slides, but they were unable to isolate them.  

- in 1951, houwink developed a method for isolating this genus. he discovered that the stalk was an outgrowth of the cell rather than an excreted appendage, leading to the term *prostheca* (staley, 1968).  

- in 1962, stove and stanier observed *caulobacter* and noted that mother cells gave rise to polarly flagellated, non-prosthecate daughter cells (*swarmer* cells), which later lost motility and developed a stalk in place of the flagellum.  

- in 1964, pondexter discovered *asticacaulis*, which had subpolar appendages. similar to *caulobacter*, it exhibited a dimorphic life cycle, where a flagellum was later replaced by a prostheca. typically, *asticacaulis* had biprosthecate cells.  

- in 1970, we isolated a non-motile fusiform *caulobacter* fitting the description of henrici and johnson. initially, we obtained one isolate (which was not reported), followed by three more, and now we present our findings.

- **strains.** strains needed to be isolated and cultivated using standard methods to ensure reproducibility. they followed houwink’s protocol, which employs a 0.01% peptone culture—a minimal nutrient medium designed to prevent the overgrowth of organisms that thrive in richer media.  
  - enrichment cultures (with 0.01% peptone) were incubated for 1–3 weeks, allowing bacterial populations to reach appreciable numbers.  
  - 0.01% peptone agar plates were prepared to transfer the cultures for colony isolation.  
  - agar plates were incubated for 1–2 weeks at room temperature.  
  - individual colonies were examined using phase-contrast microscopy on wet mounts.  
  - samples were collected from raw sewage, a wastewater treatment facility, a university lake, a pond near another university, and a marl pond.  

- **media.** various culture tubes were prepared to assess carbon source utilization and vitamin requirements.  
  - vitamin requirements were tested using a defined medium, with three consecutive transfers in DM (defined medium) with and without the vitamin solution.  
  - carbon source utilization was assessed using DM without glucose, with each compound added at a final concentration of 0.2% (w/v) after sterilization and filtration.  
  - cultures were incubated for 30 days at 30°c.  
  - phase-contrast microscopy was used to determine cultural purity.  
  - for all other experiments, a complex medium (MMB) was used, distinguishing these cultures from the enrichment cultures.  

- **physiological tests.**  
  - temperature range tolerance was tested using a gradient block (0–40°c) after 30 days of incubation.  
  - anaerobic growth was tested in MMB with and without alternative electron acceptors, following incubation in a gaspak container.  
  - dna was extracted using the marmur method, and base composition was determined by buoyant density centrifugation in CsCl.  

- **electron microscopy.** cells were stained with 0.2% PTA and other contrast agents.  

- **life cycle studies.** photomicrographs were taken at periodic intervals using a zeiss ultraphot microscope.  

- **phage typing.** phages were obtained from various institutes, and plates were incubated for one week.

- fully differentiated prostheca’s width: 0.1-0.2μm (other caulobacters’ : 0.085μm.)
- they have a characteristic bulbous tip. (it means it is distinctive and defining feature.)

![Prosthecobacter fusiformis](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2acd9bb-c877-475a-9398-830ad43e987d)

- they completely lack crossband structures (querbalken).
- there was some variation in the extent to which cells had differentiated prior to separation.

**fine structure.**

- cytoplasmic constituents including ribosomes were found extending into the prostheca of FC3.
- cell wall, gram negative.

**growth cycle.**

- the cell elongates at the nonprosthecate pole.
- cell septum forms and the daughter cell differentiates.
- newly formed prostheca was usually shorter than that of the mother cell at the time of cell seperation.

### discussion

- superficially the fusiform caulobacters described herein resemble Caulobacter.
    - similarities:
        - they have a single polar appendage (to attach substrata with holdfest at the tip of it)
        - they grow in dilute organic media, sharing certain nutritional and physiological features with Caulobacter and Asticcacaulis.
    - differences:
        - prosthecobacteria don’t have a dimorphic life cycle with non-motile, prosthecate mother cells and motile non-appendaged daughter cells.
        - mother cell divides to give rise to a daughter cell which is an identical mirror image of the mother cell at the time of seperation.
        - the prostheca is wider and terminates in bulbous tip in fully differenciated cells.
        - no crossbands.
        - no flagella, fimbrae are numerous.
        - phages of Calobacter and Asticcacauli can’t affect them.
        - dna base composition value: 54.6 to 60.1/
- then they propose it as a new genus and discuss naming.
