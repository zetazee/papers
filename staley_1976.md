> they explain their findings and justify why the organism should be classified as a new species.

- they collected samples from freshwater sources.  
- four strains of heterotrophic fusiform caulobacters were isolated from these samples.  
- morphologically, these bacteria resemble *Caulobacter*. they possess a single prostheca extending from one pole of mature cells, which aids in attachment to various substrates through a holdfast located at the distal tip of the appendage.  
- however, they differ in several key aspects:  
  - they lack the dimorphic life cycle of *Caulobacter*. Instead of producing motile, non-stalked daughter cells, their daughter cells are immotile and are identical mirror-image replicas of the mother cells.  
  - the prosthecae of these fusiform caulobacters lack crossbands, are wider, and end in a bulbous tip.  
  - their DNA base composition (GC content) ranges from 54.6% to 60%, whereas *Caulobacter* has a GC content of 62â€“67%.
